1) Install Intel PCM
wget https://github.com/intel/pcm/archive/refs/tags/202210.tar.gz
tar -xvf 202210.tar.gz
cd pcm-202210
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

2) Use PCM inside testcases
logger::start();
/*Do something*/
logger::end();

Note that there are some initialization related code in logger::start(). You have to call that piece
of code only once during the execution. E.g., you can make it as a part of argolib::init API.

logger::end shows how to use metrics such as JPI, EDP, and IPC.

3) Compile test cases
Set PCMROOT = /absolute path to the directory/pcm-202210 inside Makefile
make

4) Run test cases
sudo modprob msr
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PCMROOT/build/lib ./vecadd
